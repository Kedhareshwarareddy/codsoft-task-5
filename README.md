## Author: KEDHARESHWARA SUBBA REDDY S

## Batch:(NOVEMBER A13)

## Domain: PYTHON Programming

## Aim:

The aim of this project is to create a Contact Book which Stores name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.

 ## Working of the code-

1. **Contact Class:**
   - The code defines a `Contact` class with attributes such as name, phone, email, and address to represent individual contacts.

2. **ContactManager Class:**
   - The `ContactManager` class manages a list of contacts and provides methods to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts.

3. **Adding Contacts:**
   - Users can add new contacts by providing information such as name, phone, email, and address. The contact is then added to the contact list.

4. **Viewing Contacts:**
   - The user can view the list of contacts, displaying names and phone numbers for each contact.

5. **Searching Contacts:**
   - Users can search for contacts based on a keyword, which can be either a part of the name or the entire phone number.

6. **Updating Contacts:**
   - Users can update contact information by providing a contact name and new phone, email, and address. The contact is then modified accordingly.

7. **Deleting Contacts:**
   - Contacts can be deleted by specifying the contact name. The corresponding contact is removed from the list.

8. **Menu-Driven Interface:**
   - The program utilizes a menu-driven interface where users can choose options (1-6) for various operations like adding, viewing, searching, updating, or deleting contacts.

9. **Input Validation:**
   - The code includes basic input validation, ensuring that the user provides valid choices and input when interacting with the contact management system.

10. **User-Friendly Experience:**
    - The application runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit, providing a user-friendly experience for managing contacts.



1. **Entry Field (`entry`):**
   - An Entry widget is used to display and input numeric values and mathematical operations.

2. **Numeric and Operation Buttons:**
   - Buttons for digits 0-9, decimal point '.', and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are arranged in a grid layout using `tk.Button`.
